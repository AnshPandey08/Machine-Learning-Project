# Real State Price Prediction 

This data science project series walks through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using Banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step would be to write a Python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. The third component is the website built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to enter the home square ft area, bedrooms, etc and it will call Python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building, we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k-fold cross validation, etc. Technology and tools this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

# Setup to Run the Project

1. Fork or download the whole project to your local machine.
2. Setup Nginx for Windows.   [Download](https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.27.3.zip)
3. Now, Go to the nginx.exe file, double-click on it, and Open the Task Manager to check whether the nginx files are running.
4. After, configuring the nginx.config  text file (set the "root user" as YOUR "app.html" Directory address and in the next line edit and add app.html or whatever filename you will save the webpage.
5. After this, Open the Postman API to check the API calls at GET and POST.
6. Now, go to the web server and search localhost in the search bar, find the web UI page.


# Things to Add-in

I have to add and deploy my project on any cloud server so that it would be a bit easier to check the Project.
